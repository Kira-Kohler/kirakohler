Lyrics by Kira Kohler 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.700
Me and my girlies

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.200
We gon' party 'til it's early

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Got me feelin' otherworldly tonight

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.400
Caught in some traffic

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.100
But the radio is blastin'

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000
Drop a red light and we'll
sing it goodbye

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.400
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
By the mornin', feel like magic

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.400
I got all I need

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.200
You know nothing else can beat

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.900
The way that I feel when I'm
dancin' with my girls

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.300
Perfect energy

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.200
Yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.900
There's no better feelin'
in the whole wide world

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.100
Tonight

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.800
I don't care what's wrong or right

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400
Don't start blowin' up my line

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.500
I'd care at 11:59

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.400
But nothing counts after midnight

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.300
Come and take a ride with me

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.700
I got a credit card and
some good company

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.400
Some come through, make
the fit real good

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.400
Why you still stuck on loading?
Waitin' on you, babe

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.700
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.500
Night to mornin', live slow motion

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.800
I got all I need

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.600
You know nothing else can beat

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.400
The way that I feel when I'm
dancin' with my girls

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.800
Perfect energy

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.600
Yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.500
There's no better feelin'
in the whole wide world

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.800
Tonight

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.300
I don't care what's wrong or right

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.900
Don't start blowin' up my line

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.200
I'd care at 11:59

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.650
But nothin' counts after midnight

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.150
Oh

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.900
Oh, oh (Hahaha)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.900
By the mornin', feel like magic

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.200
I got all I need

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.900
You know nothing else can beat

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.900
The way that I feel when I'm dancin'
with my girls (Yeah)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.300
Perfect energy (Uh-huh)

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.000
Yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.800
There's no better feelin'
in the whole wide world

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.800
Tonight

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.300
I don't care what's wrong or right

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.100
Don't start blowin' up my line

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.700
I'd care at 11:59

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.800
Don't start blowin' up my line

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:50.800
