00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.800
Why must you always insist...

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.000
That the universe grant you special privileges?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You've upset the natural order

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.500
You do realize that, don't you?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.600
That there are rules, there is no cheating fate

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.900
What's the point of being a witch if I can't help the ones I love?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.900
You've crossed a line this time

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900
No, no... No, you've completely erased it

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There's no reason to think that the spell will fail

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.900
Lyrics by Kira Kohler

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.700
Will you hold the line

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.950
When every one of them has given
up and given in, tell me

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.600
In this house of mine

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.900
Nothing ever comes without a consequence
or cost, tell me

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.300
Will the stars align?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.900
Will heaven step in? Will it save
us from our sin? Will it?

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.600
'Cause this house of
mine stands strong

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.000
That's the price you pay

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.700
Leave behind your heart and cast away

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.600
Just another product of today

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.200
Rather be the hunter than the prey

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.100
And you're standing on the edge,
face up 'cause you're a...

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.400
Natural

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.800
A beating heart of stone

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200
You gotta be so cold

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.500
To make it in this world

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.000
Yeah, you're a natural

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.300
Living your life cutthroat

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.800
You gotta be so cold

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.000
Yeah, you're a natural

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.600
Will somebody

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.200
Let me see the light within
the dark trees' shadowing

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.200
What's happening?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.000
Looking through the glass find the
wrong within the past knowing

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.000
Oh, we are the youth

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.800
Cut until it bleeds inside a world,
without the peace, face it

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.300
A bit of the truth, the truth

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.600
That's the price you pay

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.300
Leave behind your heart and cast away

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.200
Just another product of today

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.000
Rather be the hunter than the prey

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.000
And you're standing on the edge,
face up 'cause you're a Natural

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.300
A beating heart of stone

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.800
You gotta be so cold

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.100
To make it in this world

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.500
Yeah, you're a natural

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.900
Living your life cutthroat

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.400
You gotta be so cold

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.300
Yeah, you're a natural

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.300
Deep inside me, I'm fading
to black, I'm fading

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.800
Took an oath by the blood of
my hand, won't break it

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.600
I can taste it, the end
is upon us, I swear

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.900
Gonna make it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.400
I'm gonna make it

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.700
Natural

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.100
A beating heart of stone

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.500
You gotta be so cold

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.900
To make it in this world

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.300
Yeah, you're a natural

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.800
Living your life cutthroat

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.200
You gotta be so cold

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.400
Yeah, you're a natural

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.900
Natural

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.700
Yeah, you're a natural

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.700
